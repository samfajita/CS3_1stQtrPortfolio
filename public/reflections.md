# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
## 1. Loops
### I am experienced in loops in C++ because of CS1 and CS2, and the classes this quarter have helped me become even better. I have become good at the use of for, while, and do-while loops, as well as nested loops. Loops have now become an important and often used part of my coding activities, and I feel confident in my work whenever I use them.
## 2. Variable Definitions
### Similar to loops, I am experienced in declaring variables because of CS1 and CS2. With the introduction of Javascript, I discovered new ways to declare variables such as let and var. After practicing coding tasks, I am know comfortable with variable declaration in both C++ and Javascript.
## 3. Conditional Statements
### I am also good at using conditional statements as it is also part of my prior years in Pisay. This quarter, there was the introduction of the ternary operator "?:", and it further expanded my knowledge on ways to write conditional statements for code. Now, I am able to switch between using either, as I am very confident in my capabilities with if-else statements and the ternary operator.
## 4. Javascript Syntax
### This year included the programming language Javascript in CS3. Because of this, I dedicated this quarter to learning the syntaxes for things like variable declaration and other Javascript statements. After learning a lot about it, I am now comfortable with Javascript.
## 5. Functions
### Functions have been a topic since last year, and I've gotten even better at it in the first quarter this year. With the introduction of C++, I learned how to declare functions and how to use them in a new language. It also helped improve my overall understanding of functions, and now I understand functions well enough to be able to use it confidently in my code.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
## 1. HTML Syntax
### This whole quarter has been about HTML, but I still struggle to grasp a lot of key concepts about it. The syntaxes for displaying things in a browser are still not yet second nature in my mind, and I still need more practice for it. Syntaxes like "getElementById", or the html tags such as "b" or "span" are some things I still don't fully understand, and I want to be able to go further into these topics.
## 2. Links
### Up until now I have very little knowledge on link making. It has been one concept that I haven't grasped, as I don't understand the steps it takes to make links. In questions where it asks to determine which is the correct way to make a link, I usually get them wrong, as most of the time I am clueless about it.
## 3. VsCode
### I do not understand how VsCode works and how to use it properly, as I do not understand the functions of the different buttons and its effects. Majority of the quarter, I've just been following the steps of my teacher and everyone else in order to use VsCode, but I never fully understood the effect of actions such as "Commit" or "Sync Changes" as I didn't look into it further. I want to be able to understand VsCode as a whole and not just blindly follow instructions.
## 4. Github
### Similar to VsCode, I do not understand how Github works and what it is for. The actions I took to connect it with VsCode, and words and phrases such as repository or live server are things I don't understand well, as I have just been blindly following instructions. Just like VsCode, I want to be able to know the buttons im pressing and the actions I'm doing, and not just follow instructions without knowing their effect.
## 5. Markdown
### I am currently using Markdown to write this reflection, and I have very little knowledge about it. I am not familiar with the things that can be done using markup, and currently I only know how to use headers and numbered lists. I wanna be able to get better at markup and become more experienced so that I can use it in my futue work.
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
## I plan to use extra academic time to practice on my weakpoints in coding by using practice examples and studying different syntaxes. I also plan to consult with teachers so that I can get any clarifications on the things I am unsure about. There are also a lot of online sources, so I plan on using them to learn about the things I am still struggling on.
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
## Effective
### 1. Kahoot
#### The Kahoot quizzes help connect the students through fun and healthy competition. It also allows the teacher to see common sources of error among people, and explain common misconceptions and ideas.
### 2. Speed Tests
#### Similar to Kahoot, it is healthy and fun competition for bonus points, and it also challenges students to perform under pressure. This will help students think faster as well as do well under nerve-racking tests like mid quarter and end exams.
## Ineffective
### 1. Long Lectures
#### Despite being filled with important knowledge, long lectures often don't help students as students often lose focus because of many factors such as boredom and sleepiness. The presence of an airconditioner all the more makes it harder to focus, as the place becomes too comfortable to listen attentively, and it ends up becoming a place to rest.
### 2. Q1 1st Graded Exercise - Making Your Portfolio
#### I believe that this exercise was a good introduction to the 1st Quarter. However, I believe it is unnecessary to conduct that activity in class, as the whole activity is just reading and following instructions. I believe it would've been more effective to use the period for a more teacher involved activity instead, and the portfolio should've been a do at home task.
